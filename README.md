# 👋 Hi, I'm L17

🎓 I'm a cybersecurity student at a technical college, with a focus on red teaming, ethical hacking, and offensive security. I'm passionate about learning how real-world attackers operate—and how to defend against them.

💻 I'm actively building a hands-on portfolio by working through labs on:
- [TryHackMe](https://tryhackme.com)
- [PortSwigger Web Security Academy](https://portswigger.net/web-security)

🔒 My goal is to become a red team operator and ethical hacker. This GitHub is my public learning journal and project space—everything here is real work I’m doing to build skill, not just to show off.
